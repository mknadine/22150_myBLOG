      <p> How to Set a Goal</p>
<p>
First consider what you want to achieve, and then commit to it. Set SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and time-bound) goals that motivate you and write them down to make them feel tangible. Then plan the steps you must take to realize your goal, and cross off each one as you work through them.

   If you were already fit and had hobbies like cycling, running or going to the gym, the transition to lockdown life may not be as difficult as you think. If you are keen to adopt the healthiest lifestyle you can in these strange, unique times, you will certainly feel the benefit. Better sleep, better mindset are all huge rewards gained by keeping fit.
